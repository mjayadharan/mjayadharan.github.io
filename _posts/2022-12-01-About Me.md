## My background in a nutshell.  
---------------------
- __I am a computational scientist with expertise in numerical analysis, high performance computing, and scientific machine learning. I am interested in application of computational and stastistical learning methods to a wide range of scientific fields including natural sciences, geosciences, physical systems etc.  I currently work as a Quantitative Research Analyst for the Citigroup's Credit Quant group in NYC.__
- I have experience in developing and implementing novel algorithms to solve multiphysics CFD problems, using both data-driven deep learning techniques and classical mixed finite element methods (FEM).
- I have many years of teaching experience teaching courses spanning over pure and applied mathematics. 
- Currently, I work as a credit quant specializing in pricing and risk management of credit derrivatives in the risk-neutral framework, specifically in LATAM emerging markets. 
- I love working on new challenging models and implementing them, while collaborating with others. 
- Always looking for new collaborators and interesting projects. 
#### Languages I work with: 
- __Python__ for general purpose programming and ML software development.
- __C++__ for high performance scientific computing and simulations.
#### Mathematical Skills: 
- __Numerical Analysis__.  
- __HPC__ Parallel computing.  
- __Advanced Probability, Statistics__.  
- __ML,DL__.  
- __Biocomputing__.
- __Math Finance and Stochastic Calculus__.  
- __Risk Neutral Pricing and Hedging of Credit derrivatives__.
- __Bonds, CDS, XCCY swaps__.
- __CFD__ Computational Fluid Dynamics.   




#### Software packages I currently use:
- __ML/ Data Science__: Numpy, Pandas, Jupyter, Keras-Tensorflow2
- __Visualization__: Matplotlib, ParaView, gnuplot.
- __Scientific computing__: deal.II, FreeFem++, phoenix.
- __My favorite editors and IDEs__: Eclipse, Jupyter notebook, Colab, Emacs.
#### Languages and packages I used to work with: 
- Fortran, Matlab, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
